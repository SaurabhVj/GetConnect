This is one of two Android Apps to save time for user by tracking Govt.official's location and helps in Navigation of Govt. Departments. User side App is [LetTheVipDown](https://github.com/SaurabhVj/LetTheVipDown). 
This app is for Professor (idea can be extended for Govt. Officials), from which we can track his/her location, if he is present in the Geofence of the Govt. building user can be notified of his/her presence in the department and save his time. Officials can create their subcircle so 
that concerned people can only know his location. The navigation feature can be used by 
them to navigate the campus and explore all facilities .
